# Comparison-of-Sorting-Algorithms
- Aim of the repository is comparing several well-known sorting algorithms for given selection problem.
- Comparison made by **empirical experiment** based on thier **time complexities**.
- Algorithms:
-        Sort all elements with insertion-sort and return k'th element.
-        Sort all elements with merge-sort and return k'th element.
-        Sort all elements with quick-sort and return k'th element.
-        Partial Selection-sort
-        Partial Heapsort
-        Quick-select (not sorted list
-        Quick-select (median-of-three pivot selection
